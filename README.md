Enjoy a game of war with a friend, game consists of 1 deck pulled from an API. Each time you click "draw 2 card" 2 cards are pulled from the deck at random and vs each other. The game ends once the deck runs out.

NOTE: When using chromes developer tool to shrink the screen to the size of a mobile device the game looks messed up but on all mobile devices I've tested this on the game looks fine. Initially I was having the issue of the game looking fine on chromes developer tool but not on any mobile devices. If anyone has some insight feel free to help out.
